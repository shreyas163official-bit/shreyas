Replit Prompt: Shreyas Portfolio Website

Create a fully responsive, single-page portfolio website for me using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no React, no frameworks, and no external build tools.

The design should be professional, sleek, creative, and minimalistic — the kind of personal site a modern developer or creative professional would have. Use smooth animations and a balanced color palette (soft dark tones with a clean accent color). Keep all the code clean, commented, and easy to customize.

⚙️ Tech setup

Files: index.html, style.css, and script.js

All assets (images, videos) should be in an /assets folder.

Use plain HTML, CSS, and JS only. No external frameworks, no libraries.

Use CSS variables for color themes (so I can edit easily).

Add dark mode / light mode toggle that remembers the last setting using localStorage.

Use Intersection Observer for scroll animations and parallax effects (no third-party libraries).

Optimize for mobile (responsive layout + hamburger menu).

🧩 Website Structure

Header / Navbar

Fixed at top, with smooth scroll to sections: Home, About, Work, Contact.

On desktop: visible inline menu.

On mobile: hamburger button that expands a sliding navigation panel.

Include a dark/light toggle switch in the header.

Hero Section

Large, simple hero area with:

A photo placeholder (assets/me.jpg) for my picture.

My name (Shreyas) and a short tagline.

Two buttons: “View My Work” (scrolls to portfolio) and “Contact Me” (scrolls to contact section).

Add a subtle animated accent — for example, gradient text or underline that glows gently.

Include a smooth parallax background layer for depth.

About Section

Section title: “About Me”

Bio text (use the one below).

Show small animated skill bars or counters for:

Video Editing — 3 years

Graphic Design — 1 year

Web Development — 1 year

Add another image placeholder (can reuse the same photo).

Smooth scroll-in animation (left/right slide with fade).

Work Section

Title: “My Work”

Contain three clearly separated sub-sections:

Video Editing — use video thumbnails or posters; clicking opens a modal to play videos (placeholders in /assets/videos/).

Graphic Design — grid of design thumbnails (images that open larger in modal view).

Web Development — screenshots of web projects; each has title, year, and short tech stack text.

Each sub-section uses the same layout grid style with cards.

Add hover effects (lift + subtle shadow).

On scroll, use unique animations for each category (not the same appear effect).

Contact Section

Title: “Let’s Connect”

Include a simple contact form:

Name, Email, Message, Subject (dropdown for “Video Editing”, “Design”, “Web Dev”, “Other”).

Submit button (for now, just mailto: link or no backend required).

Include icons or text links for email, social media, or phone.

Add a vCard download button (assets/shreyas.vcf placeholder).

Footer

Small copyright text like:
“© 2025 Shreyas — Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript”

Include a “Back to Top” smooth scroll button.

💡 Animations & Interactions

Use smooth scroll for internal links.

Implement scroll-triggered animations using Intersection Observer (fade-up, slide-in, or parallax shifts).

Create different animation styles per section (e.g., hero fade-in, about slide-in, project cards scale-in, contact fade-up).

Parallax effect: slow background movement behind the hero or section titles.

All animations must be subtle, professional, and GPU-optimized using transform and opacity.

Add a progress bar at the top that fills as you scroll down the page.

🎨 Design & Color Palette

Default: sleek dark theme — deep navy / charcoal background with clean white or gray text.

Accent color: something bright but elegant (like teal #00d4aa or cyan #00ffee).

Light theme: pure white background with dark text and same accent.

Use a consistent sans-serif font (like Poppins, Inter, or Open Sans — load via Google Fonts).

Keep consistent spacing and large clean headings.

All sections should have smooth transitions and soft rounded edges (not boxy).

✅ Extra Details

Include comments like <!-- Replace this image with your own --> for easy customization.

Lazy-load large images and videos.

Ensure everything looks sharp and professional on desktop, tablet, and phone.

Avoid kiddish animations or over-the-top transitions — everything should feel refined and deliberate.

Don’t use CDNs or external CSS libraries (everything local).

Add developer notes in comments at the top of each file explaining how to edit or extend the site.
