Create a single-page portfolio using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript — no frameworks, no external build tools. The design should be cinematic, professional, and themed around cybersecurity + gaming: think a dark, filmic Netflix-style showcase for projects, with tasteful terminal / SOC dashboard elements and gaming/PlayStation nods. Keep it elegant and credible — no childish graphics or over-the-top “hacker” memes.

Files & structure: deliver index.html, css/styles.css, js/main.js, and an assets/ folder with placeholders. Add insightful inline comments explaining how to swap media and edit text. Use CSS variables at the top for easy color and spacing tweaks.

Global style / mood:

Dark, cinematic background (deep charcoal / near-black) with soft vignette and subtle film grain overlay (CSS).

Accent neon color(s) — one primary (teal/cyan) and one secondary (mild magenta or amber) for highlights.

Use a clean geometric sans font (e.g., Inter or Poppins — load via Google Fonts locally if permitted).

Design language: glassy panels, subtle neon outlines, thin borders, crisp rounded corners, and generous whitespace. Everything feels “pro” and slightly cinematic.

Header & nav:

Fixed, compact header with logo (text or small SVG), links: Home / About / Work / SOC / Gaming / Contact.

Include a dark/light toggle that persists in localStorage and respects prefers-color-scheme.

On small screens use a hamburger that opens a slide-in nav; keep transitions smooth and accessible.

Hero / Cinematic Showcase:

Create a Netflix-style horizontal poster carousel for featured projects (large cards that pan horizontally). Use left/right arrow controls and swipe support on mobile. Cards show project title, short tagline, year, and micro-badges (Video / Design / Web / SOC). Provide placeholders assets/poster1.jpg, etc.

Under the carousel show a small “quick stats” strip: Experience Years, Projects, Active Tools (icons).

Add a subtle parallax background (animated particles or slow-moving grid) for depth — GPU friendly via transform.

About / Personal panel:

Two-column layout on desktop: left = portrait (assets/me.jpg) in a stylized frame (gloss/scanline overlay), right = short, badass, professional bio (see bio below).

Show experience chips: Video Editing — 3y, Graphic Design — 1y, Web Dev — 1y, and a dedicated Cybersecurity badge (add years if you want).

Include a small skill radar or stacked bar visualization (pure CSS/JS) showing competency categories: Video, Design, Frontend, Pentesting, SOC, Scripting. Make it subtle and professional.

Work / Portfolio (three content flavors):

Use a carousel + grid approach: Featured projects in the top carousel; below it, a Netflix-like row for each category (Video Editing, Graphic Design, Web Dev, Security Tools / SOC Demos). Each row is horizontally scrollable with keyboard nav.

Each card contains: thumbnail, title, short blurb, tags (tools), and a “View” CTA. Clicking opens an accessible modal with detailed content (video player or image carousel, project notes, role, tools, year, and optional link). Modal must be keyboard navigable and closable with Esc.

Security / SOC demo cards: show interactive fake dashboards (placeholder data) — e.g., live alerts count, severity donut, recent events list, and a mini terminal viewer that replays sample commands/logs (text animation). Provide clear comments so the owner can replace fake data with real screenshots or log files.

SOC / Terminal Section (interactive but safe):

Create a dedicated “SOC” panel with two columns: left = live metrics cards (CPU load, alerts, connections, suspicious IPs) animated with mild transitions; right = an interactive terminal component that simulates typed commands and outputs.

Terminal should be cosmetic (no actual system access) and allow the user to configure command sequences via a data- attribute or JSON block in js/main.js. Include copy button for logs, pause/play for typing effect, and keyboard focus styling. Use monospace styling, subtle green/amber prompt colors, and an accessible contrast.

Add a compact “Threat Timeline” scroller below showing mock events with timestamps — make it visually like a SOC timeline (not cartoonish).

Gaming / PlayStation corner:

Add a short “Interests” card showing gaming rigs, favorite consoles (PlayStation icon), and a small gallery of gameplay/video edits. Include a stylized gamepad icon and a “Projects — Game Mod / Clips” row. Keep it tasteful and professional: show editing reels, mod ideas, or security-related gaming projects.

Micro-interactions & animations:

Use Intersection Observer to trigger distinct entry animations per section (hero: cinematic fade/pan; about: slide + mask reveal; carousels: slight 3D tilt on hover; SOC cards: pulse on alert increase). Avoid cookie-cutter fade-only effects.

Add a smooth scroll progress bar at the top and subtle hover glows on actionable items.

Make carousels accessible (aria roles, keyboard arrow nav).

Performance & accessibility:

Lazy-load heavy images and videos. Use loading="lazy" and preload only for the hero poster. Keep animations GPU-accelerated (transform, opacity).

Semantic HTML, alt attributes, color contrast compliant, and modals accessible via keyboard. Provide aria attributes for dynamic widgets.

Contact & CV:

Contact form (Name, Email, Subject dropdown: Video / Design / Web / Security / Other, Message). Form action can be a mailto: placeholder or a commented fetch snippet for future backend.

Offer a downloadable CV and vCard (assets/shreyas.pdf, assets/shreyas.vcf). Provide social links (GitHub, LinkedIn, PlayStation ID) as icons.

Developer notes & customization:

Put clear comment markers where to replace images, video files, and project metadata. Offer a simple JS array of project objects at the top of js/main.js so I can add/edit projects without editing HTML.

Use CSS variables for colors, spacing, and accent neon. Add a short comment block explaining how to change accent color and font.

Keep JS vanilla, modular (IIFE or single main.js), minimize global scope pollution, and avoid libraries. Provide helper functions for carousels, modals, progress bar, and terminal playback.

Deliverables:

index.html (clean, semantic, commented), css/styles.css (variables, responsive rules), js/main.js (project data and interactive behavior), /assets with placeholder images/videos and README comments at the top of index.html.

Include at least 3 sample featured projects (1 video, 1 design, 1 web/security demo) and at least 6 smaller cards across rows to show structure.

Tone for copy:

Crisp, confident, professional. Short punchy headings. No AI-sounding fluff.

Example short bio (use as-is in About):

I’m Shreyas — a cybersecurity-minded creative who builds polished video edits, brand visuals, and secure front-end experiences. I bring 3 years of video editing, 1 year of graphic design, and 1 year of web development experience, and I’m obsessed with SOC workflows, automation, and game tech. I design with clarity and ship with security in mind.
